Risky Business
## Background

Mortgages, student and auto loans, and debt consolidation are just a few examples of credit and loans that people seek online. Peer-to-peer lending services such as Loans Canada and Mogo let investors loan people money without using a bank. However, because investors always want to mitigate risk, a client has asked that you help them predict credit risk with machine learning techniques.

In this assignment you will build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data you'd typically see from peer-to-peer lending services. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans), so you will need to employ different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes. You will use the imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using the two following techniques:

1. [Resampling](#Resampling)
2. [Ensemble Learning](#Ensemble-Learning)

Use the above to answer the following questions:

* Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
>
* Which model had the best recall score?
>
* Which model had the best geometric mean score?

#### Ensemble Learning

In this section, you will train and compare two different ensemble classifiers to predict loan risk and evaluate each model. You will use the [Balanced Random Forest Classifier](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier.html#imblearn-ensemble-balancedrandomforestclassifier) and the [Easy Ensemble Classifier](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/imblearn.ensemble.EasyEnsembleClassifier.html#imblearn-ensemble-easyensembleclassifier). Refer to the documentation for each of these to read about the models and see examples of the code.

The Below steps were completed for each model:

1. Train the model using the quarterly data from LendingClub provided in the `Resource` folder.

2. Calculate the balanced accuracy score from `sklearn.metrics`.

3. Display the confusion matrix from `sklearn.metrics`.

4. Generate a classification report using the `imbalanced_classification_report` from imbalanced learn.

5. For the balanced random forest classifier only, print the feature importance sorted in descending order (most important feature to least important) along with the feature score.


The Questions answered based on the midold are available on the ipynb files at the end .

* Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

* Which model had the best recall score?

* Which model had the best geometric mean score?

* What are the top three features?
